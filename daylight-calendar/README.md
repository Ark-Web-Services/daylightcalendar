### Connecting a Touchscreen

2. Configure your preferences in the Configuration tab
3. Start the add-on
4. The add-on automatically detects your display and starts in kiosk mode

### Troubleshooting Display Issues

If your display shows a command line instead of the calendar:

1. Make sure `kiosk_mode` is enabled in the add-on configuration
2. Check that your Home Assistant device has access to the display devices by verifying the permissions under "Hardware" in the add-on configuration page

To exit kiosk mode temporarily, press the `ESC` key.
